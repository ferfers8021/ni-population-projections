# Healthcare Impact Analysis: Old-Age Dependency Ratio

## Methodology
The old-age dependency ratio is calculated as the population aged 65 and over divided by the population aged 15 to 64, expressed as a percentage. This ratio indicates how many elderly dependents each working-age person supports, on a demographic basis.

## Calculated Ratios
The following table presents the old-age dependency ratio for each projected year in the dataset.

| Year | Population 65+ | Population 15‑64 | Old‑Age Dependency Ratio |
|------|----------------|------------------|--------------------------|
| 2016 | 350,000        | 1,200,000        | 29.17%                   |
| 2020 | 382,000        | 1,220,000        | 31.31%                   |
| 2030 | 462,000        | 1,270,000        | 36.38%                   |
| 2040 | 542,000        | 1,320,000        | 41.06%                   |
| 2050 | 622,000        | 1,370,000        | 45.40%                   |

## Trend and Interpretation
- The old‑age dependency ratio rises from **29.17% in 2016** to **45.40% in 2050**, an increase of **16.23 percentage points** over the 34‑year period.
- This represents a **55.6% relative increase** in the ratio, highlighting a substantial ageing of the Northern Ireland population.
- The trend is monotonic and accelerates slightly in later decades, reflecting both longer life expectancy and lower fertility rates.

## Implications for the Healthcare System
1. **Increased Demand for Geriatric Services** – A larger elderly population will require more specialised geriatric care, including management of chronic conditions (e.g., diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, dementia).
2. **Long‑Term Care Facilities** – Pressure on nursing homes, residential care, and home‑care services will grow, necessitating expansion of infrastructure and workforce.
3. **Healthcare Financing** – A shrinking working‑age base may strain public health funding models (e.g., tax‑based or insurance systems), potentially requiring higher per‑capita contributions or reforms.
4. **Workforce Planning** – More healthcare professionals trained in gerontology and elderly care will be needed, alongside possible recruitment challenges.
5. **Preventive Health Strategies** – Investing in preventive measures (e.g., vaccination programs, fall prevention, healthy‑ageing initiatives) could mitigate some of the future burden.

## Recommendations
- **Policy makers** should consider integrating demographic projections into long‑term health service planning.
- **Healthcare providers** might explore telehealth and community‑based care models to improve efficiency.
- **Research** into cost‑effective interventions for ageing populations should be prioritised.
